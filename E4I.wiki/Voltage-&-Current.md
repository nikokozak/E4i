## Voltage is the cause, current is the effect
It's possible to have voltage without current, but current cannot flow without voltage.


## Voltage
Voltage is the potential energy between two points in a circuit. In the plumbing analogy, the amount of water acts as the charged particles and voltage is the water pressure.

- Voltage = **Potential difference**
- Voltage is **used up inside components**, but not in wires.
- Voltage is measured in **Volts, or the symbol V.**
- Voltage is measured across a component
- Voltage is measured by a **voltmeter** connected in **parallel**
- In electrical equations, the symbol for voltage is V.

#### Voltage at a point & the concept of 0V (zero volts)
- Voltage is the **difference between two points.**
- In electronics, we talk about **voltage at a point** in ref to voltage difference between that point and a reference point of 0V.
- Zero volts could be at any point in a circuit.
For consistency, it is usually at the **negative terminal of a power supply.**

#### Zero volts for circuits with a dual supply
- Some circuits require a dual supply.
- For these circuits, zero volts exist as the middle terminal.
- On complex circuits, the earth/ground symbol is used to mark zero volts.


## Current
- Current is the rate of **flow of a charged electrons.**
- Current is **not used up,** what flows into a component must flow out.
- Current is measured in **amps (amperes), or the symbol A.**
- The unit of current is coulombs per second: **1 A = 1 C/s**
- Current is measured with an ammeter connected in **series.**
- In electrical equations, symbol for current is I.


## Voltage and current for components in series
- **Voltages add up** for components connected in series.
- **Currents are the same** through all components connected in series.
- Example: two components are connected in series, one component uses 2V and the second uses 4V, they add up to 6V.
- The current through both of those components stay the same all the way through the circuit.

## Voltage and current for components in parallel
- **Voltages are the same** across all components connected in parallel.
- **Currents add up** for components connected in parallel.
- Example: two components are connected in parallel, one component uses 30mA and the second uses 60mA, they add up to 90mA.
- The voltage supplied by the power supply to the whole circuit stays the same.

#### Important notes when talking about electronics:

***Current flows through*** things while ***voltages are applied across*** things. Make sure we use the correct vocabulary - say "current through a device" and "voltage between two points" or "across two points" in a circuit. This is because voltage is used up by components at different points in a circuit, so the voltage at any given point could vary and we only get current by placing voltage across things, pushing the charged electrons through the circuit.

>To say something like “the voltage through a resistor ... ” is nonsense. However, we do frequently speak of the voltage at a point in a circuit. This is always understood to mean the voltage between that point and “ground,” a common point in the circuit that everyone seems to know about."" - The Art of Electronics
