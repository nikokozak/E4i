**Diodes allow electricity to flow in only one direction.**

Diodes are small semiconductors that have two leads, an anode and a cathode. The diode operates by allowing electrons to flow in only one direction, called the forward direction. Any current trying to flow in the reverse direction is blocked. Diodes are like a one-way valve for electrons.

When the anode of the diode is given a voltage that is more positive than the cathode, it is said to be **forward biased**. This allows the diode to "turn on" and allow current to flow through. The reverse condition is called **reverse biased** and causes the diode to be in an "off" state, blocking any current from flowing through.
