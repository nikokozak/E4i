THU 2:50-5:50pm

## Overview

Today we no longer solely connected to the digital world through computers. The result of this push to connect the digital and the analog world is the increasing necessity for low cost, low power, and self-contained electronics.

This course is an applications-driven intro to electronics for inventors. Through a hands-on approach, students will learn basic concepts about analog circuits, Boolean logic, digital devices interfaces, and low-cost code-free electronics.

Topics will include basic principles of electricity, as well as an understanding of electronics components such as resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, audio amplifiers, and timers.

This class will use as a backbone the book "Practical Electronics for Inventors - 4th Edition" by Paul Scherz and Simon Monk.

## Requirements

**Pre-requisites**  
 Prerequisites include an open mind, interest for electronics, the drive to make, and physical computing.

**Readings**   
This class will use as a backbone the book "Practical Electronics for Inventors - 4th Edition" by Paul Scherz and Simon Monk, this is a required textbook. [link](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Electronics-Inventors-Fourth-Scherz/dp/1259587541)   

It is expected that you will spend 6 to 8 hours a week on the class outside of class itself. This will include reviewing material, reading, watching videos, and learning about electronics. Please budget your time accordingly.

**Supplies**   
You will need basic supplies for circuit prototyping. [list](Supplies)

**Assessment**  
***50%***  Demonstration of understanding of concepts explained in the class lectures, workshops and text.   
***30%***  Participation in class and workshops.   
***20%***  Attendance and Punctuality.   


More than two absences will result in a failing grade. Arriving to two classes more than 10 minutes late counts as an absence. Please notify me as early as possible if you are unable to come to class.

Please see ITP's statement on [Pass/Fail](http://help.itp.nyu.edu/academic-policies/pass-fail) which states that a "Pass" is equivalent to an "A" or a "B" while anything less would be considered a "Fail".


**Conduct**  
This class meets every THU from 2:50pm to 5:50pm.
Please be punctual and respectful to each other.

**Participation**  
This class will be highly participatory. You are expected to contribute to discussions, follow the Labs, build the circuits, and otherwise fully participate in class.

## Terminology   
The field of Electronics, Electrical Engineering, and Technology in general, has traditionally presented outdated, archaic, problematic, ableist, and racist language. This class will make use of inclusive and gender-neutral terminology. [Suggestions/Alternatives](Terminology) 

## Inclusivity  
This class is a harassment-free, and inclusive space for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, disability, physical appearance, age, race, ethnicity, political affiliation, national origin, or religion — and not limited to these aspects.

## Statement of Academic Integrity

Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else.

## Statement of Principle

The core of the educational experience at the Tisch School of the Arts is the creation of original academic and artistic work by students for the critical review of faculty members. It is therefore of the utmost importance that students at all times provide their instructors with an accurate sense of their current abilities and knowledge in order to receive appropriate constructive criticism and advice. Any attempt to evade that essential, transparent transaction between instructor and student through plagiarism or cheating is educationally self-defeating and a grave violation of Tisch School of the Arts community standards. For all the details on plagiarism, please refer to page 10 of the Tisch School of the Arts, Policies and Procedures Handbook, which can be found online at: http://students.tisch.nyu.edu/page/home.html

## Statement on Accessibility

Please feel free to make suggestions to your instructor about ways in which this class could become more accessible to you. Academic accommodations are available for students with documented disabilities. Please contact the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities at 212 998-4980 for further information.

## Statement on Counseling and Wellness

Your health and safety are a priority at NYU. If you experience any health or mental health issues during this course, we encourage you to utilize the support services of the 24/7 NYU Wellness Exchange 212-443-9999. Also, all students who may require an academic accommodation due to a qualified disability, physical or mental, please register with the Moses Center 212-998-4980. Please let your instructor know if you need help connecting to these resources.

## Statement on Title IX
   
Tisch School of the Arts is dedicated to providing its students with a learning environment that is rigorous, respectful, supportive and nurturing so that they can engage in the free exchange of ideas and commit themselves fully to the study of their discipline. To that end, Tisch is committed to enforcing University policies prohibiting all forms of sexual misconduct as well as discrimination on the basis of sex and gender. Detailed information regarding these policies and the resources that are available to students through the Title IX office can be found by using the following link: [NYU Title IX Office](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/equal-opportunity/title9.html) 

## Statement on use of Electronic Devices

Laptops will be an essential part of the course and may be used in class during workshops and for taking notes in lecture. Laptops must be closed during class discussions and student presentations. Phone use in class is strictly prohibited unless directly related to a presentation of your own work or if you are asked to do so as part of the curriculum.

## Privacy

This is a space where everyone is welcome to participate, learn and share. Students are expected to respect each other's privacy, both online and in person. While taking this class students, instructors and guests agree to not record, capture, or take snapshots, unless previously agreed upon.
Recordings will be made for accommodation purposes only and will not be published online or shared otherwise.
